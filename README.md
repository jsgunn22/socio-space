# Socio-Space

## Description

With so many social media platforms to choose from these days its very hard to find something that isn't flooded with advertisements, influencers, political biases, etc. Socio-Space is a modern solution for an older, simpler concept for social media. It lets us connect with people that we want to share our thoughts with and allows them to respond. Ask questions, share your opinions, call someone out. Socio-Space keeps things simple by allowing us to share only text. No photos, videos, links... let's keep it simple.
